# AGV-UART-Task
ðŸ“Œ Brief Overview
Design a controller for a simulated version of the YDLIDAR X2 two-dimensional LiDAR sensor, which is actually present on the Mushr bot in the AGV lab, using Verilog.
The controller must include UART receiver and transmitter modules.
It should:
- Receive UART packets
- Store the data bytes
- Identify different parts of the data
- Process the data
- Output the results
